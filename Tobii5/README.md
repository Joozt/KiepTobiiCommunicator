# Tobii Dynavox Communicator 5 page sets

Tobii Dynavox Communicator 5 can be downloaded [here](https://www.mytobiidynavox.com/Support/Communicator5). If you don't activate or start the trial mode, you can test out the page sets and edit them. You have to press a key combination now and then, and in fullscreen it shows that it is in evaluation mode.

## First version
To get to a working version, first version is limited to:
 - Fresh set of pages, based on the page sets delivered with Communicator 5
 - Speak "yes" and "no" using AutoHotKey with .WAV files instead of baked into every page
 - Non-user-editable main menu, as the editable menu is confusing for the user
 - **Keyboard** screen
  - Increased font size on alphabet buttons
  - Increased default font size for text box
  - Send a backup/log e-mail with text box contents when clearing
  - Speak last sentence instead of whole text box contents
  - Add full-screen mode, when using qwerty keyboard instead of on screen keyboard

## Next versions
 - **E-mail**
  - Increased font size everywhere
 - **TODO**, working with the .TXT files page sets and preferably synchronized using Dropbox
 - **Agenda**, used for quick access to [KiepVisitorRegistration](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepVisitorRegistration) and [KiepAgendaViewer](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepAgendaViewer)
 - **Z-wave**, used for quick access to [KiepLamp](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepLamp)
 - **CloudRover**, used for quick access to [KiepRover](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepRover)
 - **Minimize/close**
