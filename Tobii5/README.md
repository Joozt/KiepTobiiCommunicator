# Tobii Dynavox Communicator 5 page sets

Tobii Dynavox Communicator 5 can be downloaded [here](https://www.mytobiidynavox.com/Support/Communicator5). If you don't activate or start the trial mode, you can test out the page sets and edit them. You have to press a key combination now and then, and in fullscreen it shows that it is in evaluation mode.

## Installation
To set the `hoofdmenu.cddx` as startup page, edit the `Home page` property in `UserOptions.ini`
To set the `toetsenbord.cddx` as global keyboard, edit the `FavoriteCommunicatorKeyboard` property in `UserOptions.ini`

You can find `UserOptions.ini` in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Tobii Dynavox\Communicator\5\Users\[my profile name]\Settings`
